This folder will provide a full demonstration of functional connection analysis on OIS 200 Captured Data.
The demo data was located at 'D:\ZR\_Data_Temp\Ois200_Data\Full_Demo'

Pipelines are as follows:

################## Preprocess
1. Transfer .bin file into python-readable format
2. Time-course bin, down sample series into freq required.
3. Project series into standard space.
4. Filter(0.005-0.5Hz), generate dR/R and Z matrix.
5. Get data matrix of all brain area. Chamber mask, is important for it.


################## Correlation Methods
1. Seed point Correlation(window-slide)
2. Correlation matrix(re-arrange added)(ignore area less than 50 pix inside.)
3. Contralateral similarity calculation
4. 2-area(can combine area as required) specturm analysis(wavelet and slide window fourier)
5. Phase Locking Analysis(Hilbert transform)




################### Pattern Recognition
0. ROI Timecourse Heamap(re-arrange added)
1. Raw PCA analysis
2. ROI-based PCA analysis
3. Ensemble Timecourse Repeat Analysis.(Peakfind & Waittime)
4. Neuro-Trace of spontaneous activity
5. Hierarchical clustering pattern Recognition
6. Seed point growing method

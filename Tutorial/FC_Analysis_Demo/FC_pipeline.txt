This folder will provide a full demonstration of functional connection analysis on OIS 200 Captured Data.
The demo data was located at *datapath*

Pipelines are as follows:

################## Preprocess
1. Get R value matrix from bin file
2. Time-course bin, down sample series into freq required.
3. Select bin, pin Bregma, Lambda, and other 3 point, calculate affine transform model
4. Transfer R value matrix to given pattern, get standard resolution maps.
5. Filter(0.01-0.5Hz), generate dR/R matrix

6. Chamber mask, set pix outside chamber as 0.
7.

################## Correlation Methods
1. Seed point Correlation(window-slide)
2. Correlation matrix(re-arrange added)(ignore area less than 50 pix inside.)
3. 2-area(can combine area as required) specturm analysis.


################### Pattern Recognition
0. ROI Timecourse Heamap(re-arrange added)
1. Raw PCA analysis
2. ROI-based PCA analysis
3. Hierarchical clustering pattern Recognition
4. Ensemble Timecourse Repeat Analysis.(Peakfind & Waittime)
5. Neuro-Trace of spontaneous activity

## Lulab_OI_Infrastructure

  This pakage works for mice brain neuroimaging data processing. Codes is designed for whole brain imaging of intrinsic optical imaging, but it might work for calcium fluorescence imaging too. 
  After several major update, this pakage now works as a basic toolbox, and include a standard graph atlas inside.

### Functions Included:
You can always try demos in /Tutorial folder. Functions include:
1. Transfer captured data to standard brain atlas
2. Divide brain area and calculate corr matrix
3. Pattern find on spontaneous resposne 
4. Time-course information of spontaneous response
